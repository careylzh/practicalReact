# practicalReact
- [ ] how to pass in props from a "layout file" to compound components(made of up sub components)
- [ ] conditional rendering based on media-query (eg. different constituents for different sizes, different colours, position of elements, new elements for smaller screens etc) through adding a new feature prop
- [ ] relative linking <link> vs <a> tag
- [ ] rephrase: "how do I refactor this component into a separate file such that I pass in the correct placeholder props in the new file into the function body?" 
- [ ] file organisation (rephrase: keeping function body for high-level logic, hooks in the same location, you can only call hooks in the return body of the function etc)
- [ ] hooks for fetching data, passing parameters
- [ ] internalisation of standard text using react.intl
- [ ] overwriting styled components 
- [ ] conditional rendering using the Typescript data type *Record* and custom hooks (it's almost like switch case implemented as components) 
- [ ] why class components are outdated (eg. benefit of hooks can be only used in the newer functional component definition, and not )
